What is the baseline ?
- A simple model that you are confident should perform reasonably well. 

Why is it important to start with a baseline?
- Without starting with a sensible baseline ,it will be difficult to know whether your fancy models are any good.

What are the two main ways data scientists are measuring distances?
- mean absolute difference, also called L1 norm
- Root mean squared error (RMSE) or L2 norm

What are two important points of broadcasting in PyTorch?
- PyTorch doesn’t actually copy mean3 1,010 times. It pretends it were a
tensor of that shape, but doesn’t allocate any additional memory.
- It does the whole calculation in C (or, if you’re using a GPU, in CUDA, the
equivalent of C on the GPU), tens of thousands of times faster than pure
Python (up to millions of times faster on a GPU!). 

What is a Perceptron? 

What is a nonlinear Activation function?

# The Process of developing Neural Networks
1. Initialize: Random Values as Parameters
2. Loss: Testing the effectiveness of the current weights
3. Step: increase or decrease the weights
4. Stop
