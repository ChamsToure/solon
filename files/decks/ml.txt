What does an imputer do? 

- It is an Imputation transformer for completing missing values

What are some actions you need to do for Data Cleaning?
1. The ML algorithms wont work with missing features, so you have to take care of them, for example with an imputer
2. You can also get rid of the whole attribute of the missing features

The important objects of Scikit-Learns API:
- Estimators
- Transformers
- Predictors

Why do you have to write your own custom Transformers?
- Because I need custom cleanup operation
- Or have to combine specific attributes

What do you have to do to create your own Transformers, when It have to work seamlessly with Scikit-Learn functionalities?
- Creating a class and implement three methods:
    1. fit() - returning self
    2. transform()
    3. fit_transform()

What is the most important transformations you need to apply to your data and why?
- Feature Scaling, because Ml algorithms dont perform well when the input
numerical attributes have very different scales

What can you do to get all attributes to have the same scale?
- min-max scaling (normalization)
- standardization

How to execute all the data transformations in the right order?
- One good possibility is to use the Scikit-learn Pipeline class, that helps
with such sequences
